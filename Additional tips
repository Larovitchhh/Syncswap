SyncSwap Context: SyncSwap is a DEX on zkSync Era, using zkRollups for low-cost, secure transactions. If your project involves smart contracts, ensure compatibility with zkSync’s infrastructure (e.g., zkEVM Solidity Compiler).

Security: If you’re building tools or contracts, conduct audits to avoid vulnerabilities, as SyncSwap emphasizes security through audited smart contracts.

Community Engagement: Link to SyncSwap’s community (e.g., Discord or Twitter
) for updates and feedback.

Airdrop Potential: SyncSwap has speculated about a potential “SYNC” token airdrop for early users. You could include scripts to automate testnet/mainnet interactions to increase eligibility.
